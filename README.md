<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About 

All my personal configuration files

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over 
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
